# LeetCode solutions in JavaScript 

This is my way for learning algorithms on JS.

Repository with prepared empty tasks for training in [Example folder](https://github.com/Barklim/leetcode-javascript/tree/master/example) with test cases.

```
/**
 * 1. Two Sum
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices
 * of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you
 * may not use the same element twice.
 *
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  
};

const example1 = twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9); // [0,1]
const example2 = twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6); // [1,2]
const example3 = twoSum([3, 3], 6); // [0,1]

console.log(example1);
console.log(example2);
console.log(example3);
```

## Test cases

Test cases is groupped inderections for learning in propper order for learning how it recommended in [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)

```
example
    0.ArraysHash
    1.TwoPointers
    ...
    18.MathGeometry
```
